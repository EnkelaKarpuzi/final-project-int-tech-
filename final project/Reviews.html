            <p>The Meta Quest 3 will be the next iteration of the current consumer-focused headset line, probably sold at a subsidized price in order to bring more users into the ecosystem. The headset is expected to be an evolution, rather than a revolution, of the current Quest, lacking technology such as eye-tracking, which is expected to be present in the next generation of higher-end headsets. The Quest Pro, on the other hand, is aimed at productivity use for professionals who want to get involved with building the virtual worlds that will make up the metaverse.</p>

            <p>Apple has been making consumer smart watches for a few years now, but late 2022 saw the introduction of a new model designed to compete with the high-end sports and luxury models recently introduced by competitors such as Garmin and Tag Heuer. The Apple Watch Ultra is encased in a titanium shell, making it more hard-wearing and durable than any previous Apple Watch. It also has a brighter, scratch-resistant screen, a powerful proprietary S8 processor, and a battery that lasts almost twice as long between charges. New sensors include a depth gauge and water temperature sensors, both aimed at divers.</p>

        <h3>Ring Always Home Drone Camera</h3>
        <h4>Review</h4>

            <p> The latest addition to Ring’s suite of smart home security devices is an autonomous drone designed to patrol your property, enabling you to have eyes on places that static security cameras just won’t reach. First teased back in 2020, the Always Home drone cam was finally shown in prototype form at this years’ CES. Although there are still no concrete details of when it will be available, reports suggest that it will cost around $250, which seems quite affordable for such a high-tech piece of home security gadgetry. As well as potentially alerting you to intruders, it could also come in handy for forgetful homeowners wanting to check that they didn’t leave the kitchen stove on or the windows open.</p>
